IxQuick-Dark-Elegant
====================

A [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/stylish/) theme for IxQuick.
ixquickDarkElegantHideAds.css hides IxQuick ads.
ixquickDarkElegantDisplayAds.css makes them obvious.

The style works only with the "air" theme. Make sure to use this theme in IxQuick preferences.
Some pages like configuration/FAQ are excluded from the theme.
