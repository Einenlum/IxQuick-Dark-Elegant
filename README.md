IxQuick-Dark-Elegant
====================

A [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/stylish/) theme for IxQuick.
ixquickDarkElegantHideAds.css hides IxQuick ads.
ixquickDarkElegantDisplayAds.css makes them obvious.

The style works only with the "air" theme. Make sure to use this theme in IxQuick preferences.
Some pages like configuration/FAQ are excluded from the theme.

Thanks to there.is.only.xul from freenode #firefox who helped me to understand Stylish and its mechanisms, and thanks to bionx (the author of [ixquick clean & minimal](http://userstyles.org/styles/85730/ixquick-clean-minimal)) whose code helped me to replace some elements.
